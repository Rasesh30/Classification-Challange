# Classification-Challange

# Homework Description
The objective is to enhance the email filtering system for an Internet Service Provider's customers. Using a dataset containing information on emails labeled as either spam or not spam, the aim is to build a supervised machine learning model that can accurately identify and filter out spam emails from customer inboxes. This involves developing two classification models—Logistic Regression and Random Forest—training them on the dataset, and evaluating which model is more effective at detecting spam.

All of the code is written by me with the help of my class notes.
